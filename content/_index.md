      Iâ€™m currently pursuing a PhD at Aalto University in the field of acoustics and audio signal processing.
      My research focuses on spatial audio, microphone array processing, and spatial post-filtering techniques,
      with a particular interest in compact and low-order directional arrays. Iâ€™m especially interested in improving
      spatial resolution and robustness in real-world acoustic environments using spatial coherence and beamforming methods.

      My broader interests include machine learning for audio applications, perceptual evaluation of spatial audio in
      virtual and augmented reality, room acoustic modeling, and physical modeling tasks such as the auralization of scattering effects.
      I also enjoy teaching and sharing knowledge â€” you can find a selection of [courses Iâ€™ve taken](https://stwir.github.io/courses/)
      and [teaching activities](https://stwir.github.io/teaching/) on this site.

      I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from Friedrich-Alexander-UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg
      and completed my Masterâ€™s thesis at the International Audio Laboratories Erlangen (AudioLabs).

      Besides my academic work, Iâ€™m interested in chemical processes applied in the production of liquid which can be enjoyed on various occasions.
      
      Cheers!"
