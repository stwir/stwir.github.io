 This paper proposes a spatial post-filter for speech enhancement in reverberant environments such as meeting rooms and lecture halls, using widely distributed microphones. The method operates in the time-frequency domain by aggregating phase-corrected cross-spectral similarities between microphone pairs to form a unified spatial filter. This filter can be applied to omnidirectional or beamformed signals to extract a target source from a mixture while reducing the influence of spatial aliasing. The approach is evaluated in simulated multi-talker scenarios and validated through objective performance metrics and subjective listening tests under varied acoustic conditions. Results demonstrate robust suppression of interference and consistent enhancement of the desired source.
