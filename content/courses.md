## Courses
A selection of courses I have taken during my Masters and PhD studies:

### Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (M.Sc. Studies)

Grades are on a scale from 1.0 (Very Good) to 4.0 (Pass), with 1.0 being the highest grade with 0.3 increments. (German Grading System)

- Advanced Topics in Information Theory (1.0)
- Audio Processing Seminar (1.0)
- Communication Electronics (1.3)
- Communication Networks (2.3)
- Digital Communications (2.7)
- Digital Signal Processing (1.7)
- Equalization and Adaptive Systems for Digital Communications (1.0) 
- Global Navigation Satellite Systems (1.3)

- Microwave Engineering (2.3)
- Mobile Communications (2.0)
- Speech Enhancement (1.0)
- Speech and Audio Signal Processing (2.3)  
- Statistical Signal Processing (2.3)

Research Project: "Block-Online Implementation of Independent Vector Analysis" (Python)
- Implemented a block-online version of Independent Vector Analysis (IVA) for blind source separation of convolutive mixtures.
- Block-online IVA processes audio in chunks, allowing real-time applications and moving source scenarios.
- Compared performance with traditional online IVA and evaluated in simulated reverberant environments with moving sources.


### Aalto University (Ph.D. Studies)

Grades are on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest grade. 

- Coding Virtual Worlds (5/5)
- Deep Learning (5/5)
- Kernel Methods in Machine Learning (5/5)
- Machine Learning for Mobile and Pervasive Systems (5/5)
- Machine Learning with Python (5/5)
- Machine Learning: Supervised Methods (5/5) 
- Virtual Acoustics (5/5)
