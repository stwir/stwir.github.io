### Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg  
*(M.Sc. Studies)*

Grades are on a scale from 1.0 (very good) to 4.0 (sufficient), with 1.0 being the best grade. (German grading system - Steps: 1.0, 1.3, 1.7, 2.0, 2.3, 2.7, 3.0, 3.3, 3.7, 4.0)

- Advanced Topics in Information Theory (1.0)  
- Audio Processing Seminar (1.0)  
- Communication Electronics (1.3)  
- Communication Networks (2.3)  
- Digital Communications (2.7)  
- Digital Signal Processing (1.7)  
- Equalization and Adaptive Systems for Digital Communications (1.0)  
- Global Navigation Satellite Systems (1.3)  
- Information Theory and Coding (1.3)  
- Microwave Engineering (2.3)  
- Mobile Communications (2.0)  
- Speech Enhancement (1.0)  
- Speech and Audio Signal Processing (2.3)  
- Statistical Signal Processing (2.3)

#### Research Project

**Block-Online Implementation of Independent Vector Analysis (Python)**  
Implemented a block-online version of Independent Vector Analysis (IVA) for blind source separation of convolutive mixtures. The approach processes audio in chunks, enabling real-time applications and dynamic source scenarios. Performance was benchmarked against traditional online IVA and evaluated in simulated reverberant environments with moving sources.

#### Master's Thesis
[**Impact of Diffuse and Disturbed Reflection on Room Geometry Inference Algorithms**](/uploads/thesis.pdf)


Grade: 1.0 (very good)

Supervisor: Prof. Dr. ir. Emanuël Habets

Advisor: Dr. Youssef El Baba

AudioLabs Erlangen (Joint Institute of the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg and Fraunhofer IIS)
