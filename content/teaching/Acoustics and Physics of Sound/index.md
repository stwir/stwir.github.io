Since 2021, I am a teaching assistant for the course "Acoustics and Physics of Sound" at the Aalto University in Finland. The course is part of the Master's Programme in Acoustics and Audio Technology. 

## Lectures

I've given the following lectures in the course: 

- Waves in fluids and rectangular enclosures
- Reflection and refraction in fluid boundaries
- Impedance and equivalent circuits


Additionally, I've been responsible for the seminar part of the course. The seminar includes an overview and recap of the lecture content, as well as introducing the exercises and demonstrations.
